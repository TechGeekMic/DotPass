# DotPass

## Thank you for using DotPass

Please read this carfully, as this documentation is basically a manual.

We try our hardest to include your suggestions in every version, while taking care to fix a load of bugs. If you want your features included, email us at mhartmix@gmail.com. We are very sorry if your feature isn't included or get's deleted in any version, it's either because we are squashing some bad bugs, patching security vulnerabilities, or we just couldn't include it because there are too many feature requests.

# Security
Remember, some (not many) batch files can be harmful to your PC that you download off the Internet. Only trust sources from websites that **you** trust, like GitHub!

When you use DotPass, all of the passwords that get's randomly generated aren't sent to us directly, or the cloud. It isn't even stored on your local hard disk! That's why you should write it down somewhere private in case you forget it. You can view more oon the security policy document here:
https://github.com/TheTechGeekMicx/DotPass/blob/main/security_policies.md.

# Copyright
This program is partially open-source. Read more here: https://github.com/TheTechGeekMicx/DotPass/blob/main/licensing_and_copyright. You are allowed to make features and request them, although you are jot allowed to publish them until we verify the changes made. Please do not copy the source code and create your own program or GitHub repository using it.

# How to use DotPass
Once you download the batch file located here: https://github.com/TheTechGeekMicx/DotPass/releases, we recommend that you create a shortcut on the desktop. That way, when you need a password for creating a new account, you'll have access quickly and efficiently! We also recommend that you maximise the program window, so that you can see all of the text properly and clearly too.

If you want to generate 2 passwords (2-10 passwords can be generated at one time, we may add some more options in further releases!), type in **1** like this: Choice:**1**. You can also space it out or put a closing bracket after the **1**, like Choice: **1)** if you'd like as well. This works for all of the options, too! If you want to generate 5 passwords, type in **2** like this: Choice:**2**. You can also space it out or put a closing bracket after the **2**, like Choice: **2)** if you'd like as well. This works for all of the options, too! If you want to generate 10 passwords, type in **3** like this: Choice:**3**. You can also space it out or put a closing bracket after the **3**, like Choice: **3)** if you'd like as well. This works for all of the options, too!

Once DotPass finishes generated your password(s)/PIN(s), you'll be given three options (3 does not work, read more here: https://github.com/TheTechGeekMicx/DotPass/issues/1), to either go back to the beginning of the program to generate more passwords (1), exit the program (2) or shut down your computer (3).

Hope this manual helps!
