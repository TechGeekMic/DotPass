## Thank you for using DotPass

Please go to our website for more details: https://techgeekmic.github.io/DotPass/

Please read this carefully, as this documentation is basically a manual.

# NOTE: Passwords and PINS generated are always local and we can guarantee that you will **NOT** got the same password or PIN as someone else.

We try our hardest to include your suggestions in every version, while taking care to fix a load of bugs. If you want your features included, email us at mhartmix@gmail.com. We are very sorry if your feature isn't included or get's deleted in any version, it's either because we are squashing some bad bugs, patching security vulnerabilities, or we just couldn't include it because there are too many feature requests.

# Security
Remember, some (not many) batch files can be harmful to your PC that you download off the Internet. Only trust sources from websites that **you** trust, like GitHub!

Passwords (or if you want to use them as PINs) are regenerated each time and we can guarantee that you will **NOT** got the same password/PIN as someone else.

When you use DotPass, all of the passwords that get randomly generated aren't sent to us directly, or the cloud. It isn't even stored on your local hard disk! That's why you should write it down somewhere private in case you forget it. You can view more about the security policy document here:

# Copyright
This program is not open-source. Read more here: https://github.com/TechGeekMic/DotPass/blob/main/licensing_and_copyright. You are allowed to make features and request them, although you are not allowed to publish them until we verify the changes made. Please do not copy the source code and create your own program or GitHub repository using it.

# How to use DotPass
Once you download the executible located here: https://github.com/TechGeekMic/DotPass/releases, We recommend that you maximise the program window, so that you can see all of the text properly and clearly too.

If you want to generate a password, type in **1** like this: Choice:**1**. You can also space it out or put a closing bracket after the **1**, like Choice: **1)** if you'd like as well. This works for all of the options, too! If you want to generate a PIN, type in **2** like this: Choice:**2**. You can also space it out or put a closing bracket after the **2**, like Choice: **2)** if you'd like as well.

Once DotPass finishes generated your password or PIN, you'll be given three options (Option 3 does not work, and has been temporarily removed. Read more here: https://github.com/TheTechGeekMicx/DotPass/issues/1), to either go back to the beginning of the program to generate more passwords (1), exit the program (2) or shut down your computer (3).
